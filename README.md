# Pan & Tilt Controller for Camera

In this project I built a Pan & Tilt controller for a camera to control two levels of movement of the camera using servo motors and a Joystick.

A Pan & Tilt controller is used in several type of applications including robotics, surveillance, Movie & Television or Drones.

The following image represents the movements that Pan and Tilt refers to, these controls two levels (left/right and up/down) that, when combined together will cover bigger view angles than fixed position cameras.

## Project Summary

The project comprises a microcontroller, two cameras, a slide switch, and a joystick. Each camera is controlled by two servo motors which control their movement.

This project uses the same principle as a surveillance system. The user can select the camera they want to control using the slide switch and then use the joystick to control the two corresponding servomotors that simulate pan and tilt movement for the camera.

Also, the user can use a serial terminal command to increase the gain of the joystick so the camera can move faster or slower.
